As we continue to grow and enhance our platform, we're faced with various operational costsâ€”from server maintenance to development resources.",
		"body-2": "Until now, the site has been supported by Ad Revenue, but it doesn't always cover our monthly costs to keep the site running. If we want to continue to grow the site and offer more resources, we need the support of the community.",
		"body-3": "Rest assured though that we are NOT using this platform as a way to enrich ourselves. Any money left over after overhead costs will be put right back into site through various means such as advertising, updating our UI/UX design, or a number of other ways to help enhance the Tenant experience. We'll also periodically donate to local Tenant Union's and resources to help spread the support!",
